# SUT Dataset: A New Multi-purpose Synthetic Dataset for Farsi Document Image Analysis:sunglasses::rocket:
## 1. Introduction
The **SUT Dataset** was first introduced in ICCKE 2023 conference. 
SUT dataset aims to tackle challenges associated with obtaining diverse and substantial ground-truth data for supervised models in **document image analysis (DIA)** tasks, including document **image classification**, **text detection and recognition**, and **information retrieval**.
The link to the published paper can be found in the following:

### 2. Dataset Description
The dataset comprises *62,453* images that have been categorized into *21* distinct classes, including identity documents featuring synthetically generated personal information superimposed on various backgrounds.

The dataset also includes corresponding files with labeling information for the images. The ground-truth data is organized in CSV files containing image paths and associated information about the embedded data.
