# SUT Dataset: A New Multi-purpose Synthetic Dataset for Farsi Document Image Analysis🕊️
## 1. Introduction
The **SUT Dataset** was first introduced in **[13th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (**ICCKE 2023**)](https://iccke.um.ac.ir/2023)** conference. 

The authors aim to tackle challenges associated with obtaining diverse and substantial ground-truth data for supervised models in **document image analysis (DIA)** tasks, including document **image classification**, **text detection** and **recognition**, and **information retrieval**.

### 2. Dataset Description📝
The dataset comprises ``62,453`` images that have been categorized into ``21`` distinct classes, including identity documents featuring synthetically generated personal information superimposed on various backgrounds.

The dataset also includes corresponding files with labeling information for the images. The ground-truth data is organized in ``CSV files`` containing **image paths** and associated information about the **embedded data**.
