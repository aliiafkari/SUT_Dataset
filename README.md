# SUT Dataset: A New Multi-purpose Synthetic Dataset for Farsi Document Image Analysis:sunglasses::rocket:
## 1. Introduction
The **SUT Dataset** was first introduced in ICCKE 2023 conference. 
SUT dataset aims to tackle challenges associated with obtaining diverse and substantial ground-truth data for supervised models in **document image analysis (DIA)** tasks, including document **image classification**, **text detection and recognition**, and **information retrieval**.
