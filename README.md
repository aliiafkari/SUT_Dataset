# SUT Dataset: A New Multi-purpose Synthetic Dataset for Farsi Document Image Analysis:sunglasses::rocket:
## 1. Introduction
The SUT Dataset was first introduced in ICCKE 2023 conference. 
SUT dataset aims to tackle challenges associated with obtaining diverse and substantial ground-truth data for supervised models in document image analysis (DIA) tasks, including document image classification, text detection and recognition, and information retrieval.
